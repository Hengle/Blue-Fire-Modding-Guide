However here's a summary if some things are unclear:
Blue Fire is a game made with unreal engine 4.25 so uses pak files to store data. To access this data you must unpak this pak file. For this, you must have Unreal Engine 4.25.4 installed from the epic games launcher.
Open command prompt and drag unrealpak.exe into command prompt. This .exe should be stored in UE_4.25\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UnrealPak.exe(

Then put a space and drag the pak file into command prompt. This file should be located in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Blue Fire\Blue Fire\Content\Paks assuming you installed it from steam O-O

Put a space and type -Extract. Finally put a space after that and enter the directory of the folder you want the assets to be extracted to. Press enter and the game files should extract.
