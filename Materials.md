**Credits to FatihG_ for instance editing and Dmgvol for the [GRcolorswapper tool](https://github.com/Dmgvol/GR_Guides/blob/main/Tools/GRColorSwapper.zip)**

- For colour editing, you can hex edit a material
- For this, export your material from Umodel in both ways so that you have the uasset and the props.txt
- Open the props.txt and find the values you would want to change
- ctrl+F and search for the value with these settings
- if it's a common number like one, unfortunately you'll have to use trial and error for parameters other than vector (for vector GRcolorswapper can be used)
- Make your edit, save without changing the file size and pack as normal

For automating replacing colours, use Dmgvol's [GRcolorswapper](https://github.com/Dmgvol/GR_Guides/blob/main/Tools/GRColorSwapper.zip)

- There is also an alternate method for editing material instances in engine. This is more visual e.g for vector parameter values colours can be seen in engine
