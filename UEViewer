For the next step you need umodel. Install the program from the links above and open the folder you extracted the game assets to, in my case BF_Unpaked.

With this you have access to the game files.

You can explore the game files and find something you want to replace or modify. As off now I have not managed to replace models yet so at the moment you are limited to 3d model textures and UI elements. Open a package by double clicking it. You should get a pop-up asking for the version of the package- obviously enter 4.25

Find a package you would like to replace and view it. ctrl+x to export or export by using the tools pop-down. (here are my export preferences)
