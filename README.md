### Tools and Resources
 ### General modding

  - [Epic Games launcher](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/download) by Epic Games where you can download Unreal Engine

  - [PSK and PSA importer](https://github.com/Befzz/blender3d_import_psk_psa) by [Befzz](https://github.com/Befzz) for importing exported meshes and armatures
  
 ### Code/Uasset editing
  - [Fmodel](https://fmodel.app/) by Jet Brains in an alternative to umodel that is stronger than umodel with more text based formats (this may change because fmodel receives regular updates)
  - [UassetAPI](https://github.com/atenfyr/UAssetAPI) by [atenfyr](https://github.com/atenfyr) is an API that can read and modify UE4 game assets via C# scripting
  - [UassetGUI](https://github.com/atenfyr/UAssetGUI/releases) by [atenfyr](https://github.com/atenfyr) is a thin wrapper of UassetAPI with a user interface which is more user friendly than coding with uassetAPI 
  - [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/downloads.php?product=HxD20) is a free hex editor that allows viewing, editing and searching through unreal engine assets
### Dialogue/Translation
  - [Unreal locres scripts](Tools/UE4_Locress_Scripts.zip) by swuforce is some scripts that allow editing of localisation files as long as file size is kept(a hex editor like HxD is needed)
  - [Kein's serialiser](Tools/UAssetSerialiser.zip) which of which use in blue fire is limited to stringtables (*[dotnet 3.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-3.0.0-preview8-windows-x64-installer) is needed for this*). For use reference [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1krHKG9T77cfRmIQ90k4H-fy9Vm6vVm8zR6oKAlgDiww/edit)
