# Dialogue

This guide will cover using [Kein's serialiser](Tools/UAssetSerialiser.zip) and [locres extract scripts](Tools/UE4_Locress_Scripts.zip)

In the case of Blue Fire, there are no datatables and therefore the serialiser's use only applies for stringtables. The text that is stored in a stringtable in Blue Fire includes - the Language stringtable
- Credits
- StringNames(names of characters and voids)
- StringTable(prompts and other stuff)
- TextPopUps(The popups of text that appear next to characters)
- VoidMakerTable(The base for the WIP Void Editor)
